 Stream TV as a Browser Extension
<br />
<br />
<p>
 NOTE: The extension is currently being published to the store and should be live in about 1-3 days from now. Also, you might get a little delay in fetching content for a few seconds (about 50 sec) on extension first launch due to the fact that the server needs to kickstart since it is currently running in free mode.
